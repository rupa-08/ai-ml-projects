# ðŸš— Vehicle Type Recognition using Deep Learning

This project performs **vehicle type classification** (e.g., car, truck, motorcycle, bus, bicycle) using **transfer learning with ResNet50**. A trained model is integrated with a **Streamlit UI** for easy image-based prediction.

> **Objective:** Build a deep learning model that accurately classifies vehicle images.
