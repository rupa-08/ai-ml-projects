    "### 1. Clustering:\n",
    "   - **K-Means**: A centroid-based clustering algorithm that partitions data into `k` clusters. Commonly used for market segmentation and anomaly detection.\n",
    "   - **DBSCAN**: A density-based clustering algorithm that identifies clusters of varying shapes and sizes. Ideal for noise detection in datasets like geospatial data.\n",
    "   - **Hierarchical Clustering**: Builds a tree of clusters that can be cut at different levels to form clusters. Often used in genomic and document clustering.\n",

    "### 2. Dimensionality Reduction:\n",
    "   - **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Reduces the dimensionality of data while preserving variance, making it useful for visualization and speeding up machine learning models.\n",
    "   - **t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)**: A nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique used for visualizing high-dimensional datasets like images and word embeddings.\n",

    "### 3. Association Rule Learning:\n",
    "   - **Apriori Algorithm**: Identifies frequent itemsets in transaction data and derives association rules, often used in market basket analysis.\n",
    "   - **FP-Growth Algorithm**: A more efficient alternative to Apriori for mining frequent itemsets in large datasets, commonly applied in recommendation systems."
